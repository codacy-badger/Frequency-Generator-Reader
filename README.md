# Frequency Generator and Reader

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a7f6ffc1e54c4987857f00c48a3705c7)](https://app.codacy.com/app/davidgur/Frequency-Generator-Reader?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=davidgur/Frequency-Generator-Reader&utm_campaign=badger)

The currently unnamed frequency generator and reader, which, upon completion will be used in ultrasonic utilities in industrial applications.

It interacts with the Hantek 1025G 25MHz Arbitrary function generator as well as the Measurement Computing USB 2020 high-speed simultaneous USB DAQ device.

This project was built using [Atom](http://atom.io).

## Running the Software

**Prerequisites:**
* Windows - Due to the lack of drivers, this software only works in Windows.
* Hantek 1025G Drivers - You will have to get the Windows drivers for the generator. You will probably run into problems installing these drivers because they were poorly made and I hate them.
* Measurement Computing InstaCal - This is the configuration software for the Measurement Computing USB2020.
* The Following Python Libraries:
  * MatPlotLib (Plotting)
  * NumPy      (NumPy Arrays)
  * MCCULW     (Measurement Computing SDK)

**Actually running the software:**

Simply execute ```scan.py```
